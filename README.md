# PigLatin
This is a Pig Latin Translator using the Fun Translations API and JSON to turn a userâ€™s inputted text into Pig Latin. 
In the future, I hope to incorporate an option for users to select what type of translation they want from Fun Translations.
To use, download the .py file and run the module in IDLE.
